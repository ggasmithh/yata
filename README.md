# Why?
As I used untitled_rl as a C++ refresher, and yarl (purged from internet as a matter of public safety/sanity) as a means to learn C, I'm using this (and probably not finishing it) as a means to learn Rust.

# What?
My past game-like projects have taught me to start at a scope of roughly half of what I think I can handle. I want to make this a text-based adventure, so I'll make a finite state machine instead and go from there. My moonshot end-goal is to have yata be merely a text-based adventure engine, reading states, transitions, etc, from an external file.

# Minimum viable game requirements
## Finite State Machine
* ~~Conditional Branching~~

* ~~State descriptions~~
* State transition descriptions

# Post-minimum viable stuff
## Finite State Machine
* Additional extra-gameplay states (Start/End)
* Player inventory

## Content
* Item descriptions
